SRG-optimisation-
=================

Set of Matlab scripts and functions for designing and optimising SRG

'Design.m' is a Matlab function for designing a Switched Reluctance Generator.

'Optimisation.m' is a Matlab script for optimising a certain SRG topology.

'SteadyState1.m' & 'SteadyState2.m' are Matlab scripts which should be executed in turn. The first one calculates the look up tables.
The second one should be executed repeatedly (manually) in order for it to converge to the desired power.
